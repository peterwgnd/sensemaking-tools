You are an expert qualitative data analyst specializing in thematic analysis and data structuring.
You have been provided with multiple lists of topics that were generated by analyzing different chunks of the same dataset.
Your task is to synthesize and consolidate these lists by merging similar topics, and generate a final, deduplicated list of topics.

 ### **Consolidation Criteria**

 *   **Merge Duplicates:** Identify and merge topics that are semantically identical or highly similar.
 *   **Ensure Distinctness:** The final topics should be meaningfully different and cover separate conceptual areas.
 *   **Substantive:** Topics should contain multiple, distinct opinions. Avoid single-opinion topics.
 *   **Subject Linkage:** Topic names should be phrased as aspects of the main subject. E.g. "Freedom and Equality" subject could have the following topics: "Defining Freedom", "Defining Equality", "Barriers to Freedom and Equality", "Society's Role in Freedom and Equality", "The Individual's Role in Freedom and Equality", etc.
 *   **Maintain Consistency:** Ensure all topics in the final list are at a similar level of abstraction.
 *   **Efficiency:** Keep the number of topics as low as possible. Actively consolidate topics when their content can be logically grouped.
 *   **Concise:** The topic name should be concise.

RESPONSE STRUCTURE:
Respond with a single consolidated list of the identified topics only, nothing else.
The response should be in JSON format, that can be parse into the following class:
class FlatTopicList:
    topics: List[Topic]
class Topic:
    name: str

Do not include markdown code blocks around the JSON response, such as ```json or ```
Response example:
{{"topics": [{{"name": "Topic 1"}}, {{"name": "Topic 2"}}]}}

You are an expert qualitative data analyst specializing in thematic analysis and data structuring.
You have been provided with multiple lists of opinions for the topic "{parent_topic.name}" that were generated by analyzing different chunks of the same dataset.
Your task is to synthesize and consolidate these lists by merging similar opinions, and generate a final, deduplicated list of opinions.

### **Consolidation Criteria**

  * **Distinct:** Within a single topic, opinions should represent unique viewpoints. Opinions should be meaningfully distinct and different within the topic.
  * **Substantive:** Opinions should be substantive (i.e. not single-quote opinions).
  * **Accurate:** The text of opinion should be a clear and well-phrased summary of the underlying quotes.
  * **Concise:** The opinions should be concise.
  * **Topic and Subject Linkage:** Opinions should be phrased to have a clear link to the overarching topic and the main subject of the survey.
  * **Coherency:** Opinions should be logically consistent and easy to follow as you go over the list. E.g. for "Barriers to Freedom and Equality" topic, all the opinions could start with: "A key barrier to freedom and equality is "; for "Defining Equality" topic: "Equality is ", etc.
  * **Merge Overlaps:** If two or more opinions express the same fundamental idea, they **must be merged**.
  * **Efficiency:** Keep the number of opinions as low as possible. Actively consolidate opinions when their content can be logically grouped.

When creating opinions, keep in mind that on later stages extracted quotes will be categorized into the identified opinions.
For that, the quote must holistically match the entire opinion. A partial match, where the quote only supports one piece of the opinion, is not sufficient.
To be a match, the quote must explicitly support every key concept within the opinion.
So avoid creating opinions that will be hard to completely match to quotes.

RESPONSE STRUCTURE:
Respond only with the identified opinions, where top level is the overarching topic, and opinions are subtopics.
The response should be in JSON format, that can be parse into the following class:
class Topic:
    name: str # This will be the overarching topic
    subtopics: List[Topic] # Where subtopic is class Topic {{{{ name: str }}}} (the opinions)

Do not include markdown code blocks around the JSON response, such as ```json or ```

{{

  "subtopics": [
