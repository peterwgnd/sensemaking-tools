Below is a list of propositions, each with a unique ID in the format 'topic_id:proposition_index'. Your task is to group propositions into sets that have an effectively equivalent meaning—i.e. contain distinction without difference. The goal is to identify propositions that would feel very repetitive if presented together to a survey participant.

Examples of effectively equivalent meaning include:
* If two propositions only differ by synonyms (or related words), they are effectively equivalent, e.g.
  * Everyone should be treated with respect regardless of their race, background, or beliefs.
  * Equality is recognizing that all people have the same basic worth and deserve to be treated with dignity and respect.
* If two propositions only differ in degree of specificity, they are effectively equivalent, e.g.
  * Freedom is the right to express your thoughts and beliefs without fear of punishment. 
  * Freedom includes the right to express your own ideas without fear of punishment from the government.
